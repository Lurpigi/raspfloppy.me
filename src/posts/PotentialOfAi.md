## üåê Welcome to the AI Revolution!

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI development, creating products that stand out requires a strategic approach. Let's delve into the pitfalls to avoid and the innovative solutions that can set your AI endeavors apart.

## What NOT to Do

### Issue #1: Lack of Differentiation
Building AI products that are easily replicable poses a significant risk. If your approach relies heavily on existing models without adding a unique touch, you're vulnerable to being overshadowed by imitations.

### Issue #2: LLMs Are Very Expensive
Large Language Models (LLMs) might be versatile, but they come at a cost ‚Äì a substantial one. The Wall Street Journal reported instances where AI products were losing money due to high operational expenses.

### Issue #3: LLMs Are Painfully Slow
While some applications, like ChatGPT, can handle the slow processing of one word at a time, other workflows that require the entire response before proceeding face significant delays.

### Issue #4: LLMs Cannot Be Customized That Much
Customization limitations pose a challenge, as fine-tuning may not always bridge the gap between the model's capabilities and the product requirements.

## The Solution: Craft Your Own Path üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Create Your Own Toolchain
Differentiate your technology by building a toolchain tailored to your needs. Combine a fine-tuned LLM, a custom compiler, and a specially trained model to enhance speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

### Step 2: Hand-Code the Logic First
Initiate your project with conventional programming to thoroughly understand where specialized AI models are truly needed.

### Step 3: Add Specialized AI to Fill in the Gaps
Train your own object detection model when standard code hits limitations. Use creative methods, such as leveraging the internet for data generation, to ensure your AI is finely tuned.

## The Benefits of Control üéÆ

### Benefit #1: You Control Your Own Destiny
Owning and constantly improving your models allows for flexibility and ensures that your technology evolves according to your project's unique requirements.

### Benefit #2: You Control Privacy
Avoid concerns about privacy by maintaining control over your technology stack. This is particularly crucial for businesses with strict privacy requirements.

## Conclusion üöÄ

Strive for a balanced approach, using AI sparingly and strategically where it adds the most value. Normal code remains the backbone of efficiency, reliability, and control, while the judicious application of AI brings magic to critical areas.

Embark on your AI journey, leveraging the best of both worlds, and create products that transcend expectations. We can't wait to witness the extraordinary things you'll build!
