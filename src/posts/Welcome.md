## Hello EveryoneðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone and **welcome to my Blog!**
Finally I beated my laziness and started blogging and I hope it's gonna be an amazing journey.

## Why Blogging?

I have always wanted to share my knowledge with others, and I have found that writing about the topics I know or am learning about is a good way to achieve several goals:
to **ensure that I understand** the subject well, **strengthen** my knowledge of it, and, in case I discover gaps in my understanding, **delve deeper** into the topic to cover those gaps.

Also, since **English** is not my native language, this practice is an excellent way to improve my English skills.
So, yes, I mostly do it for myself, but I also aim to create something useful for techy people.

## What's the Topics?

Good question, well I have several interest, but this blog is mostly for people in the field of computer science or techy enthusiasts, I mainly gonna talk about:

- **Coding:** Competitive Programming, Programming Languages, Linux, ecc...
- **Productivity:** Study, planning.
- **Books:** summaries of anything I read.

There may be other topics as well, but these will be the main ones.

## What I Plan?

Well if I reach out a good portion of people I would like to create a **community** on Telegram and Discord to **share** our passions, organize **events** and
most importantly create new acquaintances and friendships.

But for now just let's take off down and enjoy this new journey and once again **Welcome to my Blog!**
